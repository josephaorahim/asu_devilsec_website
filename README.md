### How to host locally
 
+ Follow the instructions to install jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). 
+ Clone repository  
+ `cd` into directory
+ Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies 
    + Execution of the script on the Linux/Mac platforms should be simple.
    + I recommend using git back to execute the script on Windows.
+ Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server
+ Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the theme
