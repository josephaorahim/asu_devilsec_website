### How to host locally
 
1. Follow the instructions to install jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). 
2. Clone repository  
3. `cd` into directory
4. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies 
  * Execution of the script on the Linux/Mac platforms should be simple.
  * I recommend using git back to execute the script on Windows.
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server
6. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the theme
